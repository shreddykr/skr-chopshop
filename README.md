üîß **Recommended Server Updates**
      For the best experience possible you will notice the notifications system being used is in fact qb notifications found in qb-smallresources under functions. To make this look better you can update that function to work with **ox_lib** since most servers
      use or have it. Personally you see me using okoknotify but rerouted in ox_lib so that if ox_lib calls for a notification it is instead okoknotify. I also have qb notifications routed to ox lib so that its easy to configure and update instead of 
      changing too much.
