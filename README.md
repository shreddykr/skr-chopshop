<h1>üõ†Ô∏è (QB) skr-chopshop - Advanced Vehicle Selling and Missions for FiveM üöóüí∞</h1>

üìú **Overview**

   skr-chopshop is a FiveM script built for the QBCore framework, allowing players to sell stolen vehicles to a chopshop NPC. Players can approach an NPC and sell their stolen vehicle for a random cash payout. The vehicle is then deleted, and the player is rewarded with cash directly. The payout ranges    from $3,000 to $10,000, with rare higher payouts configurable in the config file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üì± **Usage**

   Receive a random cash payout, and the vehicle will be removed from the game world.

**3. Participate in Chopshop Missions**
   
   Players can take on missions to locate and deliver specific vehicles to the chopshop for rewards.

   Missions are marked with blips on the map, guiding players to vehicle spawn locations.

üöÄ **Installation Instructions**

   1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/shreddykr/skr-chopshop/releases/tag/1.0.4)

   2.      ensure skr-chopshop(after all requirements)

   3.  Configure the config file

   4.  Done!

   5.  Consider rerouting qb notifications to ox_lib or read below for best UI.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üîß **Recommended Server Updates**
      For the best experience possible you will notice the notifications system being used is in fact qb notifications found in qb-smallresources under functions. To make this look better you can update that function to work with **ox_lib** since most servers
      use or have it. Personally you see me using okoknotify but rerouted in ox_lib so that if ox_lib calls for a notification it is instead okoknotify. I also have qb notifications routed to ox lib so that its easy to configure and update instead of 
      changing too much.

‚ùì **Why You Should Use This**

   Immersive Roleplay: Enhance the gameplay experience with realistic vehicle selling and retrieval mechanics.

   Seamless Integration: Works flawlessly with QBCore and popular tools like ox_target and ox_inventory.

   Engaging Gameplay: Missions and randomized payouts keep players entertained and motivated.

   Server Optimization: Automatically removes vehicles after transactions or deliveries, maintaining a clean and clutter-free game world.
